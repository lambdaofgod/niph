## Tools for searching and text mining transcribed podcasts

This project is aiming to provide utils for searching transcribed podcast sites like [Karpathy's Lex Fridman Podcast transcriptions](https://karpathy.ai/lexicap/)

Supported podcasts:
- [Lex Fridman AI Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman) based on Karpathy's transcription (also see [clips](https://www.youtube.com/@LexClips), although we do not support them yet)

## Ideas 

HAIL ANDREJ KARPATHY, GLORY TO OpenAI WHISPER!
Long live Lex Fridman and his podcast!

Because of their effort it will be easy to search and analyze transcribed podcasts.
